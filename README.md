# Rails Project Mode

Congratulations pets_database.db! We are starting project mode. This means that you'll spend the rest of the week working in a team to build out a Rails project of your choice. There will be lectures and new material scheduled throughout the week, but the bulk of the time will be working on your projects.


Some example project ideas from previous classes:

1. [Regifter](http://regifter.herokuapp.com/) - A gift trading app that lets users upload images and descriptions of unwanted gifts and propose trades with other users.
2. [Flatiron Postcard](http://www.flatironpostcard.com/) - An app that lets you create and send custom postcards to friends and family
3. Petster - A social media site for pets


Requirements:

1. You should have least five models. You do not have to have all of these built out on day one. Just having three is fine.  But by the end of the week, you should have five models.

2. Some methods in your models. Each group member should write at least 4 -5 methods. So there should be at least twenty methods total in your models.

3. Specs - there should be at least 20 specs in your project (five per person). We'll cover testing tomorrow--stay tuned!

4. Authentication

5. An analytics page - I will show some charting libraries for this in a lecture - so don't worry about displaying this data visually.  The main learning goal of this is to get you to write some interesting activerecord queries.  I will also try to have a review of advanced AR some time this week.

6. No APIs until you get approval from an instructor.  The reason is because API's oftentimes leads you to learning the API really well, but not learning rails that well.  Rails is a more transferable skill.  So try to stick with that.
